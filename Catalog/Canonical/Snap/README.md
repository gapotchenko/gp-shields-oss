# Gapotchenko Shield for Canonical Snap

Snap is a software packaging and deployment system developed by Canonical for
operating systems that use the Linux kernel and the systemd init system. The
packages, called snaps, and the tool for using them, `snapd`, work across a
range of Linux distributions and allow upstream software developers to
distribute their applications directly to users. Snaps are self-contained
applications running on a host system.
