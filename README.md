# Gapotchenko Shields OSS

Gapotchenko Shields OSS is a curated catalog of open-source .NET components that simplify integration with complementary technologies in your project.

## Overview

Many software projects depend on external technologies to enable specific features or integrations.
However, working with these technologies — especially when they are immature or poorly documented — can be challenging and prone to errors.
A technology shield addresses this by offering reliable, ready-to-use components that make integrating with these technologies easier and more robust.
