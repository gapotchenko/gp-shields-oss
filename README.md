# Gapotchenko Shields

Gapotchenko Shields is a catalog of .NET software components that help your project integrate with various complementary technologies more productively.

## Overview

Many software projects rely on external technologies for specific features or integrations.
However, working with these technologies — especially if they are immature or underspecified — can be difficult and error-prone.
A technology shield simplifies this process by providing reliable, ready-to-use components allowing you to access a specific technology with ease.
